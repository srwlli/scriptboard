  "description": "Implement a custom menu bar (File, Settings, Help) that replaces the OS title bar, with window controls (minimize, maximize, close) integrated into the menu bar. This creates a frameless window experience in Electron while maintaining browser compatibility.",
  "goal": "Create a unified menu bar that combines application menus and window controls, removing the default OS title bar to provide a cleaner, more integrated desktop application experience that matches modern app design patterns.",
  "requirements": [
    "Remove OS title bar (implement frameless window in Electron)",
    "Create custom menu bar with File, Settings, Help menus",
    "Integrate window controls (minimize, maximize/fullscreen, close) into menu bar (right side)",
    "Window controls should work via Electron IPC (minimizeWindow, maximizeWindow, closeWindow)",
    "Menu bar should work in browser environment (window controls disabled or hidden)",
    "Menu bar styling should match application theme",
    "Menu bar should be draggable for window movement in Electron"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [],
  "constraints": [
    "Must work in browser environment (window controls not applicable)",
    "Window controls require Electron IPC - graceful degradation in browser",
    "Frameless window requires Electron configuration changes",
    "Menu bar must be draggable for window movement when title bar is removed",
    "Window controls should match OS styling conventions (Windows, Mac, Linux)"
