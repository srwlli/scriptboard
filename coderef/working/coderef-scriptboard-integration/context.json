  "feature_name": "coderef-scriptboard-integration",
  "description": "Add a CodeRef panel to Scriptboard that provides a GUI for the coderef-cli tool. The panel will allow users to scan codebases, generate dashboards, query dependencies, and analyze impact through a visual interface instead of command line.",
  "goal": "Enable developers to use CodeRef's code analysis capabilities through Scriptboard's GUI, eliminating the need to use CLI commands directly and providing a more accessible way to scan code, visualize dependencies, and analyze impact.",
  "requirements": [
    "Backend FastAPI endpoints to call coderef-cli (scan, dashboard, query, impact)",
    "Frontend React panel component (CodeRefPanel.tsx)",
    "Directory picker for selecting scan targets",
    "Language selector dropdown (ts, tsx, js, jsx, py)",
    "Scan mode toggle (Regex fast vs AST precise)",
    "Results display showing element counts by type",
    "Dashboard generation and viewing capability",
    "Query interface for searching element dependencies",
    "Integration with existing Scriptboard panel system"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "Modifying the coderef-cli itself",
    "Real-time file watching",
    "RAG/semantic search features (not yet implemented in CLI)",
    "Multi-project management"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must use existing Scriptboard patterns (FileManager, LoggingConsolePanel)",
    "CLI path: C:/Users/willh/Desktop/projects/coderef-system/packages/cli/dist/cli.js",
    "Node.js must be available on the system",
    "Must handle CLI errors gracefully",
    "Dashboard HTML files need accessible storage location"
